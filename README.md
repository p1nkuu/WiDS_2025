## Project Overview
The **WiDs Datathon Global Challenge** Kaggle competition is an opportunity for BreakThrough Tech AI student fellows to apply and enhance their data science skills while working on an impactful and important problem. The BreakThrough Tech AI Program provides students with a strong foundation in machine learning, equipping them with the skills needed to tackle real-world challenges like the one presented in this competition.
## Goal of the Challenge 
The goal of his challenge is to build a model using **fMRI data** and **Socio-demographic information** to predict:
1. Individual's sex (Male or Female)
2. Individual's ADHD diagnosis
By analyzing the data, participants aim to uncover patterns and insights that contribute to a better understanding of ADHD and reveal potential biases in machine learning models used in this field.

## Real World Significance and Impact
ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately **11% of adolescents**. However, its manifestation varies significantly between **males and females**, with females often being underdiagnosed due to differences in symptom presentation. Undiagnosed ADHD can lead to long-term mental health struggles, making it difficult for individuals to access the resources and support they need to thrive.
The Wids Datathon competition leverages datasets provided by the **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)**, the signature scientific initiative of the **Child Mind Institute**, and the *Reproducible Brain Chrats project(RBC)**. Insights from this competition could help improve ADHD diagnosis, reduce gender biases in treatment, and advance research in neurodevelopmental disorders.
